# Anime-Face-Generator-

AI that generates custom anime faces from scratch. 

## Architecture

For the archtecture I chose a GAN which constisted of a generator and a discriminator. The generator continously improved to generate a better image while the discriminator continued improving to discirimante between the fake anime faces and the real anime faces given as data. 

## Results 

Shown is a picture of the first generation of training and the last generation of training. The training consisted of about 200 epochs and lasted for about 12 hours.
